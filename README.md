## HI! This is a simple golang webapp to demonstrate HOTP and TOTP 
This webapp was written to demonstrate HOTP and TOTP to Security+ students
so that they can better understand and actually use HOTP and TOTP
OATH one time passwords.

This webapp is super insecure and is only meant to be looked at as a demo
for OATH functionality, not as a viable interpretation of a fully funcitoning
webapp with thought given to security.
